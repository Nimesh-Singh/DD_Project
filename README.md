DDR2 Memory Controller

This Verilog-based DDR2 (Double Data Rate 2) Memory Controller is designed to facilitate communication between a DDR2 memory module and a digital system. It follows the JEDEC DDR2 Synchronous DRAM Specification and is intended for use in FPGA or ASIC designs.

Features:
DDR2 Compliance: The controller adheres to the JEDEC DDR2 Synchronous DRAM Specification, ensuring compatibility with standard DDR2 memory modules.

Read and Write Operations: Supports both read and write operations to enable data transfer between the digital system and the DDR2 memory.

Clock Domain Crossing: Implements techniques for clock domain crossing to synchronize signals between different clock domains, ensuring proper functioning in systems with multiple clock domains.

Burst Mode: Utilizes burst mode for efficient data transfer, allowing consecutive memory locations to be accessed without the need for separate commands for each location.

Initialization and Training: Includes support for DDR2 memory initialization and training sequences to optimize performance.

Command Pipelining: Implements command Pipelining to enhance throughput by allowing the processor to issue subsequent commands before completing the previous ones.

Error Checking and Correction (ECC): Optional support for ECC to detect and correct errors in the transmitted data.
